      "The function `b_eff(sigma, b_in)` computes the *effective bias* of the sampled halo field, given the bare bias `b_in` and the standard deviation `sigma` of the underlying Gaussian matter density field per pixel. The effective bias is defined as the response of the mean halo number density to a large-scale matter overdensity, i.e.,\n",
